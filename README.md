# go_routine_pool (gorp)
This is a package to save number of go routine.

Go routine is a wonderful functions to run featres parallel.  
But sometimes our go code reaches the limit of go routines number. In this case, I want go routines to run such as threadpool.  
I can't find those libraries, so I've tried to create it.
